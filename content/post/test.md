I had the pleasure to speak at WordCamp Prague 2019. I spoke about “10 PHP Snippets to Increase WooCommerce Sales” and managed to show some simple coding to the audience. Trust me – **increasing your WooCommerce sales can also be done with a free, short, easy PHP snippet**.

So, given that I want to share all the snippets I talked about, this is a quick recap. Copy them, test them (a must!) and then use them. And let me know if your conversion rate and/or AOV (average order value) increased!

At the bottom of the page you also find my talk slides. Enjoy:)

Where to add this snippet?

You can place PHP snippets at the bottom of your child theme functions.php file (before "?>" if you have it). CSS, on the other hand, goes in your child theme style.css file. Make sure you know what you are doing when editing such files - if you need more guidance, please take a look at my [**free video tutorial "Where to Place WooCommerce Customization?"**](https://businessbloomer.com/woocommerce-customization/)

## Does this snippet (still) work?

Please let me know in the[**comments**](https://businessbloomer.com/woocommerce-sales/#comments)if everything worked as expected. I would be happy to revise the snippet if you report otherwise (please provide screenshots). I have tested this code with Storefront theme, the WooCommerce version listed above and a[**WordPress-friendly hosting**](https://businessbloomer.com/whats-best-hosting-woocommerce-website/)on PHP 7+.
